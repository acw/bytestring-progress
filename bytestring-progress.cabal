Synopsis: A library for tracking the consumption of a lazy ByteString

Description:
  In some cases, it is useful to know how fast a ByteString is being
  consumed. Typically, this could be to report some measure of progress
  to a waiting user, but it could also be to perform some form of testing
  on input / consumption code.
